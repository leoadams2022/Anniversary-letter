          <b>My Dearest Susan,</b>
          <br /><br />
          As my birthday approaches, I can’t help but feel a mix of emotions.
          This time last year, we were together in Egypt, creating some of the
          most beautiful memories of my life. I remember the day you arrived
          just before my birthday and how excited I was to finally meet you in
          person after all those years. Our time by the Nile, that cozy coffee
          shop we both loved, and the endless moments we shared at home, just
          you and me. It all feels so close, as if it happened yesterday.
          <br /><br />
          I still smile when I think of the moment you asked me if I wanted to
          be your lover. It was something I had been thinking about for so long,
          but I was too scared to bring it up, worrying that things might get
          awkward. But you, my love, took the step, and my heart has been yours
          ever since. From that moment, on my last birthday, we became something
          truly special.
          <br /><br />
          This past year apart hasn’t been easy, but our love has only grown
          stronger. Even though we’re miles away—me in Egypt, you in Italy—we’ve
          managed to nurture and deepen our connection. You, Susan, are my
          everything, and I know that despite the obstacles and the complexities
          of our situation, we will find a way to be together, always.
          <br /><br />
          As our anniversary and my birthday draw near, I want you to know how
          much you mean to me. Our journey hasn’t been the easiest, but it’s
          been worth every step because I have you by my side. No matter the
          distance, my heart is always with you.
          <br /><br />
          I can’t wait for the day when we no longer have to count the miles
          between us. Until then, I hold on to the hope of our future together
          and cherish every moment we’ve shared.
          <br /><br />
          With all my love, <br />
          Walid<br />
        </p>
